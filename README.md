Simple reddit-esque social media like website (hopefully)

    - Fixed?
- Infinite scroll on main page
    - Don't show same posts
        - When to reset seen_post_ids??
        - **How to handle back button???**
- Polish and CSS
    - Usable on multiple screen sizes, resolutions, and mobile
    - Scroll to posted comment
- CLEAN CODE?
    - Or just move on to next project

## CSS

- Dynamic? (does it work on mobile?)
- Post page
