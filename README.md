# Poster

Simple reddit-esque social media like website (hopefully)

## TODO

- Redirect "/" ("") to "/poster"
- On signup/login redirect to where they were before
    - Same with back button
- Infinite scroll on main page
    - Sort by time, score (within last 24 hours, week, month, year, all time)
    - Don't show same posts
- Display dates
- Polish and CSS
    - Usable on multiple screen sizes, resolutions, and mobile
- Db pool instead of sql::connect_to_db() in every function
- CLEAN CODE?
    - Or just move on to next project
